"""
TODO:
- Errors with recipe add query are not creating ui pop-up
- On startup, get event summaries from calendar and update assignments in db from changes that may have been made there instead of in app
- Lunch and breakfast capabilities
- Add recipes to 'cookbook' in slides (attribute in recipe table for distinguishing dessert from main from soup...)
#- Ability to pull up current recipe, view details, and update as needed - get ingredients working...
#- Receipt entry screen to keep track of ingredient pricing
- Intelligence to project this week's grocery bill (would need some kind of inventory tracker and place to add misc foods like snacks)
- When choose main dish, auto select sides based on most common pairing
- Tab to display inventory based on chosen ingredient
