TODO:
#- Auto-set units based on units most often used in the past for ingredients
- Logic for not adding duplicate ingredients because of plurality... maybe use like query to try to catch and then throw a 'did you mean this' window for user to verify...
- Add recipe data as transaction and rollback if error occurs
#- Intelligence to project this week's grocery bill (would need some kind of inventory tracker and place to add misc foods like snacks)
- When choose main dish, auto select sides based on most common pairing
- Tab to display inventory for ingredients (basically ingredient info page -- price per unit, inventory, recipes...)
- Errors with recipe add query are not creating ui pop-up
- On date go, add column for calendar events that would affect meals
- Lunch and breakfast capabilities
- Add recipes to 'cookbook' in slides (attribute in recipe table for distinguishing dessert from main from soup...)
- Add week of date to price selection (that way can track trends of prices)
