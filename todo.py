TODO:
#- Intelligence to project this week's grocery bill (would need some kind of inventory tracker and place to add misc foods like snacks/bfast)
    - Define own conversions for foods that have mass for purchase_history and volume for recipes (i.e. pb, flour, salsa, bbq sauce, etc.)
- Grocery shopping reference list (in keep or sheets) with price/unit summaries for ingredients
- Update recipe drop downs after adding new recipe
- Quantity button on price entry tab (so would just enter price/amount of one item and then if you got like 3 then it would automatically multiply that for you)
- Add amount and notes column for purchase_history
- Tab to display inventory for ingredients (basically ingredient info page -- price per unit / last 5 purchase history, inventory, recipes...)
- Button on enter prices screen to go to ingredient info page (mostly would want to see what units the ingredient has for recipes...)
- Print average price per unit after enter price for ingredient
- Be able to update the recipe's name
- Would rather have bread added per slice.. want best price per slice rather than per oz... are there any other ingreds like this?
- Auto-set units based on units most often used in the past for ingredients
- Ingredient drop down for 'configure ingredients' screen? (Logic for not adding duplicate ingredients because of plurality... maybe use like query to try to catch and then throw a 'did you mean this' window for user to verify...)
- When choose main dish, auto select sides based on most common pairing
- Streamline casing for ingredients added to db and update current ones to fit. First letter capped and all the rest lower.
- Errors with recipe add query are not creating ui pop-up
- On date go, add column for calendar events that would affect meals
- Lunch and breakfast capabilities
- Add recipes to 'cookbook' in slides (attribute in recipe table for distinguishing dessert from main from soup...)
